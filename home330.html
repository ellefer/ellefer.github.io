 <h1>Welcome Math 330: The Art and Science of Mathematical Modeling!</h1>
 <p> Below you will find links to example code that we can use for some in-class examples and homework problems </p>
 
 <h3>Mechanistic Modeling - difference equations</h3>
 <p>Under this umbrella, we also covered things such as modeling using proportionality and geometric similarily, but we had a lot less to code! 
 You will see some of these models pop up when we talk about data-fitting</p>

  <h3>Empirical Models</h3>
 <p>We also covered models such as basic one-term models (in which we used least squares), high-order polynomial fitting, low order "smoothing" (in which we used least squares)</p>
