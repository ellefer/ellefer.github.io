    "A $\\textit{Markov chain}$, is a process in which there are the same finite number of states or outcomes that can be occupied at any given time. The states do not overlap and cover all possible outcomes. In a Markov process, the system may move from one state to another,one for each time step, and there is a probability associated with this transition for each possible outcome. The sum of the probabilities for transitioning from the present state to the next stateis equal to 1 for each state at each time step. These Markov Chains lead to linear systems; you might find more depth about theoretically finding the equilibrium states in a Linear Algebra class. Equilibrium states help us determine how the states are occupied at long term. Because we don't necessarily know linear algebra, we will make a computer compute this for us after setting up the system. \n",
